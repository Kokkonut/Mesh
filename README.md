  ## Description
Mesh is designed to be a comprehensive team capacity manager. The inspiration for its development came from observing the difficulty my wife faced when trying to determine her team's monthly capacity and forecast future capabilities – a process that was far from optimal.

The application's development began with Remix as the framework, utilizing a custom Express backend to interface with a MongoDB database, and Tailwind for CSS stylings.

Being my first experience with TypeScript, Tailwind, and Remix, I inevitably ran into some roadblocks. In the initial version, I faced significant challenges with Remix-specific components not functioning as expected. Upon analysis, I inferred that these issues likely originated from my initial configuration.

Opting for a full rebuild with a revised configuration, I managed to overcome these problems, reusing much of the original codebase. This rebuild, however, introduced a new issue with Remix V2 Routing – a feature that I decided to embrace for its novelty and appeal.

In the midst of all this, I was deepening my understanding of how Remix operates and appreciating the benefits of having the browser render pages while relegating all business logic to the backend. I also began to see the advantages of forgoing the setup of an Express server in favor of using a Remix server and Prisma to interact with my database. This shift allowed me to fully leverage Remix's "Optimistic UI".

As I navigated these changes, I realized I was accumulating a substantial amount of technical debt, even before the project truly took off. Consequently, I decided to close the current repository and undertake a full rebuild with the new structure. While this decision required significant effort upfront, it facilitated the acceleration of development and laid the groundwork for a project that adheres to best practices.

In this endeavor, my primary focus remains creating a user-friendly tool that significantly improves the efficiency of team capacity planning and forecasting.
